For others I have a different image, like a shirt that connects to your phone/electronic device and when you listen to your music (be it classical, dub step, or even heavy metal) that your shirt would have the measures of music on it. (if you don't know what "the measures of music" are then look it up on google)</p>

              <p>Martial arts is my second passion because I have been in this since I was about five, and I have grown thanks to it. I have made friend ships that will last a life time, and maybe even more. Those boys will always be my closest guy friends, not only because we are in the same class, but when I need them they are always there for me, and I am there for them. That is what true friend ship is. I have learned skills that school will not, and can not, teach you. </p>

             <p>I learned how to handle death, anger, love, sadness, stress, and how to avoid a situation that is usually unavoidable to any other person (like a physical fight). My sensei is not only my teacher, he is the closest thing to a father figure I ever had in my fourteen years of life. The reason this is not my top passion is because this is more like a hobby. I know, I know, it sounds wired, but it is what it is and nothing and no one can change that.</p>

              <p>Film production for me is for sure pure fun. I am one of those weird people that make those fake trailers, the anime combo movies, and the stupid videos on YouTube. I make monologues, scripts, hold the camera, direct, edit, do the lighting, do the sound effects, do some of the stunts, and act. I don't have all that much time to do this anymore but I hope I can soon, I miss it and it helps relieve stress at times. I have been told that I should go to a school for this kind of thing.  </p>

              <p>"Oh Linda you should make a career out of this!" Well I'm sorry to say but no. I don't want to do something fun for a living that I might get tiered of. If I do this for a living, then happens if I want to take a break from it all? It would be almost impossible to do this. I've never posted anything anywhere that I made because I never really wanted to. I mean what would be the point? It is just for fun with me and my friends. We all eventually all get a copy and then we split till the next one, unless we have a party or one of us rounds the others up for a get together.</p>
